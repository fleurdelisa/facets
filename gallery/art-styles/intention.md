# Intentions
* A carousel or grid format of various art styles with words that describe each one
* A dictionary of words related to describing that art style
* A catalog of ways to visually describe the art style wrto lighting and artistic vision direction
* Include a toggle like light/dark mode, but for live action vs animated art
* Show evolution of manga / cartoon / anime art too
